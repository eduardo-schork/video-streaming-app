_Service developed for learning purposes_

Web app built with `React.js`, `Typescript` and [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) for video streaming, communicating with my other project called [`video-streaming-service`](https://github.com/eduardo-schork/video-streaming-service).

The app was created using [`ViteRC`](https://github.com/potreco/viterc) template containing `ESLint`, `Prettier`, `Jest` and `Husky`.
